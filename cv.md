### **About me**

I have been working with CAD programs for ten years. I work at PC all the time. I have to write code in ".lin" to create new linetypes and fills.

Two years ago, I got interested in web and mobile development.

Work always takes a long time.
It's hard to force yourself to study. The motivation is higher in the team. Because I hope that at RSschool I will be able to become the real developer.
